# Bouncing-digit-dataset

## Looking for 1-digit or 3-digit or n-digit bouncing dataset. Look no further!

### Generate your own dataset with digits, images or whatever you like with!

To generate different dataset, look at the methods of `Ball.java` and 
`StdDraw.java`. The code is easily understandable!

Most of the code in this repo is taken from the site [http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/]
